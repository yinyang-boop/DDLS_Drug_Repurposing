## ðŸš€ Is your feature request related to a problem?

A clear and concise description of what the problem is. Ex: I'm frustrated that [the model currently only handles single targets].

## âœ¨ Describe the solution you'd like

A clear and concise description of what you want to happen. Please specify which part of the pipeline this feature affects:

- [ ] **Data Acquisition (Phase 1):** New database, API integration, data cleaning.
- [ ] **MCP Toolset (`mcp-pipeline`):** New RDKit function, descriptor, or deep learning encoding utility.
- [ ] **Model Architecture (Phase 2):** New model type (e.g., GNN, Transformer), loss function, or transfer learning method.
- [ ] **Workflow/Deployment (Phase 3):** Prefect improvement, new web interface, or Docker configuration.

**Specific Implementation Details (if known):**
* *For a new model:* What architecture should be used (e.g., GCN, recurrent unit)?
* *For a new data source:* Which database should be integrated (e.g., DrugCombDB, ToxinDB)?
* *For a new RDKit tool:* What specific output is required (e.g., QED, Synthetic Accessibility Score)?
